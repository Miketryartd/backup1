I'm tryin' to talk<br>Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk<br>But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you<br>‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too<br>Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now<br>Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!<br><span>[Chorus: Dido]</span><br>My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I<br>Got out of bed at all<br>The morning rain clouds up my window<br>And I can't see at all<br>And even if I could, it'd all be grey<br>But your picture on my wall<br>It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad<br><span>[Verse 4: Eminem]</span><br>Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy<br>You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?<br>Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that<br>And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap<br>I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you<br>Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you<br>But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?<br>I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?<br>You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'<br>To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some<br>And what's this shit about us meant to be together?<br>I really think you and your girlfriend need each other<br>Or maybe you just need to treat her better<br>I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time<br>Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine<br>If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan<br>Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan<br>I just don't want you to do some crazy shit<br>I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick<br>Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge<br>And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid<br>And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to<br>Come to think about it, his name was—it was you<br>Damn…</p>

  <h1>STAN</h1>
  <div class="txt0">
  <p >In this song, Eminem corresponds with a crazed fan who becomes increasingly unhinged as the story pogresses. This is one of his most well-received singles and was listed at #15 on <span id="und">VH1</span>'s <span id="und">Top 100 Hip Hop Songs of All Time</span>. <br>Eminem intended for this song to be <span id="und">a message to fans </span></b>who had written him disturbing letters indicating that they had taken <span id="und"><strong>The Slim Shady LP</strong></span>'s violent lyrics seriously. Another reason Em wrote this was to <span id="und">"make the critics who were saying things about [him] feel stupid."</span> His aim was to disprove those who felt he lacked talent and relied on shock value.<br>This song has cemented itself in histoy, with "Stan" being entered into the <span id="und">Oxford Dictionary</span> as an informal noun. It is generally considered to be a portmanteau of "stalker" and "fan," but Oxford defines the term as:<br><i class='bx bxs-quote-alt-left' id="q"></i> An overzealous or obsessive fan of a particular celebrity.<br>In a 2011 <span id="und">Shade 45</span> appearance, Em <span id="und">revealed that:</span><br><i class='bx bxs-quote-alt-left' id="q"></i>There was a verse where [Stan] got out of the water. He escaped and came to my house to kill me. Then I had to kill him first, [but] I missed him, and he was in the hospital for like three weeks. Then he was pissed off that I didn’t write him get-well cards, so he came to kill me again, and in the last verse finally I just blew his head off.<br>In 2013, Eminem released a follow-up in the form of <span id="und">"Bad Guy"</span></br></b></br></br></br></p></div>

  <h1>BMW</h1>
  <p>The song "BMW" by <span>Because (Ft. Leslie (PHL))</span> is about <span>enjoying a romantic night out in a car.</span> The song talks about how the couple's getaway is just the two of them in a car and how they should make the best of it. <span>The lyrics paint a vivid picture of how the couple is taking in the moment, appreciating each other's company, and indulging into passionate moments together.</span> The chorus emphasizes the importance of this private and intimate setting, as it talks about how the car is the perfect four seater to provide the space and privacy they need to be together. The emotion and excitement is further conveyed by the use of the words "fuck, fuckin' sa'king BMW Sedan" - which implies that they are truly enjoying their time in the car. Ultimately, this song is a celebration of the beauty of making romantic memories in a car.</p>

  <h1>Eastside</h1>
  <p><span>Lyrically, “Eastside” is a song about a couple’s journey through life, with all its trials and tribulations. The song describes two lovers who come from different backgrounds and who are trying to navigate the challenges that life throws their way.</span>

    The first verse sets the scene for the rest of the song, where the two characters are introduced. We learn about their backgrounds and how they first met. The lines “She used to meet me on the eastside/In the city where the sun don’t set” describe the location where their relationship started, and where they spent most of their time together.
    
    Throughout the lyrics, we see a <span>recurring theme of separation and longing for each other.</span> The chorus describes the desire to be close to each other again, “Back and forth like a wave/Let go of me like a wave.” It’s a metaphor for the constant ebb and flow of a relationship.
    
    The second verse explores the struggles that the two characters face in trying to stay together. <span>It’s about the challenges of making a relationship work when two people have different goals and priorities. The lyrics “She said, where’d you wanna go?/How much you wanna risk?” show the differing priorities of the two characters.</span>
    
    The bridge then changes the perspective of the song, and we see Benny Blanco addressing the listener directly. It’s like he’s giving advice on what he has learned from his own experiences. The lyrics “Don’t let me down/Strikin’ up on my own/Darn, you know that I wanna be there” are a message of hope and a reminder that even when things get tough, we can overcome them with a positive attitude.</p>
